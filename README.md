Angie's Last.fm Recommendations
======================

The idea here is to tweak the way that Last.fm recommends events to me.

I will be using hugovk's fork of pylast: https://github.com/hugovk/pylast/

I will also be using The Echo Nest (http://developer.echonest.com/)

Look into AngularJS for frontend rather than Jinja2.
